*I change interests **frequently** but Twisted Wonderland and K-pop Demon Hunters are currently my biggest ones. I'm a new TWST player! I started book 4 before deleting my account and starting over. I play on the EN server. Feel free to add me! (pVHyfAQN)*

*My favorite TWST characters are Azul Ashengrotto, Riddle Rosehearts, Cater Diamond and Ruggie Bucchi. My favorite dorms are Octavinelle and Heartslabyul!*

*I use she/her pronouns for most TWST characters as I headcannon almost all of the cast as girls or as using she/her. All my cosponies of these characters are also them as girls. o^^o*

*I also talk about my TWST OCS all the time and I love them a lot, even more than some canon characters.*

**I'm a bit shy at first and I also suck at interacting but I wanna make new friends, so please interact if me being a bit scared and bad at talking isn't a bother! ^^"**

**I also may talk non-stop when I get comfortable, so please tell me if it annoys you! :'3**

(***Also, English isn't my first language!!!***)

*I see Azul as my daughter. I treat her as so and call her my daughter almost all the time while talking about her. While I also do the same with other characters, it's mostly playful/unserious! But with Azul, it's really personal to me as I identify with and love her a lot. It's a bit more personal.*

**P.S: I know she's not real and not also really my daughter!!!**
