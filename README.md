*Hi! My name is Loveine ♥︎ I also go by Niki and Azul, but most people call me Lov for short. I'm 17, my birthday is March 9th and I'm a pisces! o^^o*

*I use any pronouns! Sometimes I have preferences but it changes constantly, so feel comfortable to ask what I feel the most happy with at the moment! I do always have a preference for feminine terms, unless I say something contrary at the moment.
Here's my [pronouns.cc](https://pronouns.cc/@OCTAVINELLE) for more info!*

*Wherever you see me hanging out with anybody, it's just me with probably Floyd since they're the only person I talk with constantly and also my best friend EVER!!!*

*My DNI is very basic; Proshippers/Profics and also people who hate/mischaracterize Azul and Riddle specifically.*

*I don't care if you dislike any other of my favs, but Azul and Riddle are very dear and important to me as I identify with both* ***heavily*** *and as I see Azul as my daughter.*

*Onto that topic, I headcannon half the TWST cast besides a few characters transfem or as using she/her. You don't have to agree with me or use she/her for them while talking with me, while it is appreciated, I dislike forcing people to agree with me. But please don't correct me on the topic or try to educate me. I really don't care and I'll still have the same view on these characters, still see them as girls and still refer to them as so.*

*I change interests **frequently** but Twisted Wonderland and K-pop Demon Hunters are currently my biggest ones. I'm a new TWST player! I started book 4 before deleting my account and starting over. I play on the EN server. Feel free to add me! (pVHyfAQN)*

*My favorite TWST characters are Azul Ashengrotto, Riddle Rosehearts, Cater Diamond and Ruggie Bucchi. My favorite dorms are Octavinelle and Heartslabyul!*

*I use she/her pronouns for most TWST characters as I headcannon almost all of the cast as girls or as using she/her. All my cosponies of these characters are also them as girls. o^^o*

*I also talk about my TWST OCS all the time and I love them a lot, even more than some canon characters.*

**I'm a bit shy at first and I also suck at interacting but I wanna make new friends, so please interact if me being a bit scared and bad at talking isn't a bother! ^^"**

**I also may talk non-stop when I get comfortable, so please tell me if it annoys you! :'3**

(***Also, English isn't my first language!!!***)

*I see Azul as my daughter. I treat her as so and call her my daughter almost all the time while talking about her. While I also do the same with other characters, it's mostly playful/unserious! But with Azul, it's really personal to me as I identify with and love her a lot. It's a bit more personal.*

**P.S: I know she's not real and not also really my daughter!!!**
